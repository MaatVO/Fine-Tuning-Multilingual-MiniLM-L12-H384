You're using a XLMRobertaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.

Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/Multilingual-MiniLM-L12-H384 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
